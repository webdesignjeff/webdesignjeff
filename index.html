        <p>Hello! My name is Jeff Woods, and I'm a motivated and brilliant front-end web developer that would love to work for you!</p>
        <p>In addition to self-taught lessons, I've received instruction from CHS Code Camp, a Charleston code bootcamp in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS3</li>
          <li>SASS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Before that, I had a career spanning many years in customer service and technical support. This gives me an excellent background in not only dealing with customers, but in communication, troubleshooting issues, handling high-pressure and rapidly-changing situations, and even being involved in training and preparing newsletters and information updates for my team.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills learned on the job, I am also very familiar with the Microsoft Office suite, especially Word, Excel, and Powerpoint, and additionally I type at 60 WPM.</p>
        <p>In my free time, if I'm not in front of my computer working on a project or playing a game, I'm at a table with my friends and a board or card game. I enjoy all manner of games, especially ones involving strategy or puzzle solving. I also can solve a Rubik's Cube. (My best time is about a minute and a half!)</p>

          <p>Sample News Page</p>
          <span class="info">This is a sample news page created in my classes at CHS Code Camp, designed to highlight features such as dropdown menus (Nav Item 2), scrollbars (the Upcoming News section), and images changing size when hovered over (the pictures of Nick Cage). The code was written in basic CSS, and the images were provided by various filler image generator sites.</span>

            <p>Star Wars Armada Scoreboard</p>
            <span class="info">This is a scoreboard app created for the tabletop game Star Wars Armada by Fantasy Flight Games, written with SCSS and jQuery. The score buttons open a prompt for how many points scored, which shows in the larger numbers in the middle of the page. The smaller numbers towards the top are used in tournaments and are calculated based on the difference in score.</span>

          <p>Warrior Knights Scoreboard</p>
          <span class="info">This is a scoreboard created for the game Warrior Knights by Fantasy Flight Games, written with SCSS and jQuery. In this game, you score one point for cities you control from a limited pool of points. I wrote this not just as a scoreboard, but to project the final scores and how many turns the game would last.</span>

          <p>Star Wars Rebellion Map Tracker </p>
          <span class="info">This is a map tracker created for the game Star Wars Rebellion by Fantasy Flight Games. In this game, the Imperial player searches for the Rebel base. This map, written with SCSS and jQuery, is helps the Imperial player flag locations that they've confirmed are not the Rebel Base. Additionally, there is a function to calculate how many units both players produce. </span>

        <p> Right now, I'm looking for a permanent or long-term front-end developer position where I can not only use my skillset but also learn and expand it. But if you have a short-term project you'd like some help on, I'd be happy to take that on. I love a good puzzle or challenge!</p>

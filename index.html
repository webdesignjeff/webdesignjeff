        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello! My name is Jeff Woods, and I'm a motivated and brilliant aspiring front-end web developer!</p>
        <!-- <img src="images/photo.png" /> -->
        <p>In addition to self-taught lessons, I've received instruction from CHS Code Camp, a Charleston code bootcamp in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5</li>
          <li>CSS3</li>
          <li>SASS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>jQuery</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Before that, I had a career spanning many years in customer service and technical support. This gives me an excellent background in not only dealing with customers, but in communication, troubleshooting issues, handling high-pressure and rapidly-changing situations, and even training and preparing newsletters and information updates for my co-workers.</p>
        <p>In addition to my technical skills learned on the job, I am also very familiar with the Microsoft Office suite, especially Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I also type at 60 WPM and can solve a Rubik's Cube. (My best time is about a minute and a half!)</p>



        <h2> Portfolio </h2>

        <div class="portfolio">
          <a href="news.html">
            <img class="preview" src="images/102preview.png" />
          </a>
          <p> This is a sample news page created in my classes at CHS Code Camp, designed to highlight features such as dropdown menus (Nav Item 2), scrollbars (the Upcoming News section), and images changing size when hovered over (the pictures of Nick Cage). The code was written in basic CSS, and the images were provided by various filler image generator sites.

        <div class="portfolio">
          <a href="armada.html">
            <img class="preview" src="images/armadapreview.png" />
          </a>
          <p> This is a scoreboard app created for the tabletop game Star Wars Armada by Fantasy Flight Games, written with SCSS and jQuery, done for practice and as proof of concept. The score buttons open a prompt for how many points scored, which shows in the larger numbers in the middle of the page. The smaller numbers towards the top are used in tournaments and are calculated based on the difference in score. </p>

            <img class="preview" src="images/warriorknights.png" />
          </a>
          <p> This is a scoreboard app created for the tabletop game Warrior Knights by Fantasy Flight Games, written with SCSS and jQuery. In this game, you score one point for each city you control from a limited pool of points. I wrote this not just as a scoreboard, but to project what the final scores would be and how many more turns the game would last. The white numbers for influence and cities for each player open a prompt upon clicking.</p>

        <div class="portfolio">
          <a href="rebellion.html">
            <img class="preview" src="images/rebellion.png" />
          </a>
          <p> This is a map tracker created for the tabletop game Star Wars Rebellion by Fantasy Flight Games. In this game, the Imperial player searches for the Rebel base. This map, written with SCSS and jQuery, is designed to help the Imperial player flag locations that they've cleared as possibilities. Additionally, there is a function designed to calculate how many units both players produce. </p>
